The CommonGround Waardepapieren Register component is a component to store certificates given out by components like the CommonGround [Waardepapieren Service](https://github.com/conductionnl/waardepapieren-service).

Certificates are stored in the form of [JWT tokens](https://jwt.io), QR codes and a PDF file containing both the QR code and the JWT token.
